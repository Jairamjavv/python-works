# Recursion

- Fibonacci series, 
- factorial finding,
- Merge sort, 
- quick sort,
- Binary search,
- Tree traversals and many tree problems: InOrder, PreOrder PostOrder
- Graph traversals: DFS [Depth First Search] and BFS [Breadth First Search]
- Dynamic programming examples
- Divide and conquer algorithms
- Towers of Hanoi
- Backtracking algorithms [we will discuss in next section]
